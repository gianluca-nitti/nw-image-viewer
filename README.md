This repository contains an example appliction for the [nw.js-global-install](https://github.com/gianluca-nitti/nw.js-global-install) project. Here you can see how to properly configure the [nw-global-build](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nw-global-build) tool and how the packages are built (see the logs on Travis-CI and Appveyor).
